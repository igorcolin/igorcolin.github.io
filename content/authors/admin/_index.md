      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a machine learning researcher in S2A team at Télécom Paris. Previously, I was a research in Noah's Ark research team at Huawei. During 2017, I was a postdoctoral researcher at INRIA, SIERRA under the supervision of Alexandre d'Aspremont. From 2013 to 2016, I was a Ph.D. student, co-advised by Stephan Clémençon and Joseph Salmon. In 2013, I graduated the Master MVA (machine learning and computer vision) at ENS Cachan and obtained the engineering degree of École des Ponts ParisTech.
